<h1>Bathroom </h1>

<p>Looking in the mirror, you remember how long it's been since you hung out with your friends. 
        All you've been able to do is chat online and the occasional FaceTime call. 
        You are surprised at the amount of people you don't miss. You called them your friends, 
        but now it strikes you how little you knew them; how distant you really were; 
        and how few real friends you had.</p>
