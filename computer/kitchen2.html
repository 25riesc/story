<p>Deciding to try to make yourself some food, you take a look at your pantry. 
        You spent the first part of your day playing games, 
        so you don't have time to make a gormet meal. 
        You see that you've got jarred marinara and spagetti noodles, so you could make spagetti. 
        You also have KFC leftovers in your fridge that you could microwave as well.</p>
